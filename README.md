# One for All
## From a student, for students

<p>Welcome! This is an open source project made by Alkaline, called One for All. One for all in short is basically a mobile application that enhances the Quality of Life experience for students. It is split into two categories, community and self. Self, is well related to one's self development (basically learning). Community relates to one's community, which includes but not limited to; communication and collaboration.</p>

<p>Using the upcoming AI features, you will be able to use AI as part of your learning process, being able to generate notes, summaries, flaschards, quizzes out of one another and documents, for just $1.99/month!</p>
